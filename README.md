##Upcoming v1.0 Release
We are on the path to our first production v1.0 release in December 2016!  We are tracking requirements in our [December Milestone](https://github.com/HTBox/allReady/milestone/15) and currently directing efforts to closing out issues in the interim [October Milestone](https://github.com/HTBox/allReady/milestone/16) starting with P1-P3 priority items that are currently being triaged and tagged.

##Project overview
allReady is focused on increasing awareness, efficiency and impact of preparedness campaigns delivered by humanitarian and disaster response organizations in local communities.  As community preparedness and resliency increases, the potential for impactful disasters (both large and small) is greatly decreased.  Though not as visible or emotionally salient as saving children from a burning building, preparedness activities like ensuring working smoke detectors in a community, follows the industry rule of thumb where an hour or dollar spent before a disaster is worth 15-30 afterwards.  The goal of allReady hinges on growing awareness of, and engaging communities and their volunteers in preparedness campaigns, and more aspirationally, to "put disaster response out of business" by preparing communities to be reslient to inevitable disasters.

The allReady project was jumpstarted by volunteers at Microsoft and has been turned over to [Humanitarian Toolbox](http://www.htbox.org/) to be maintained and improved by the technical community at large and ultimately deployed in support of organizations delivering preparedness campaigns everywhere.

The initial launch of development for allReady started on 7/20/2015 during the [Visual Studio 2015 release event](http://aka.ms/vs2015event).
