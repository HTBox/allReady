## Architecture Overview

Most of the functionality in tota11y comes from its **plugins**. Each plugin
gets its own directory in [`plugins/`](https://github.com/Khan/tota11y/tree/master/plugins) and maintains its own JavaScript, CSS,
and even handlebars. [Here's what the simple LandmarksPlugin looks like](https://github.com/Khan/tota11y/blob/master/plugins/landmarks/index.js).

[`plugins/shared/`](https://github.com/Khan/tota11y/tree/master/plugins/shared) contains a variety of shared utilities for the plugins, namely the [info-panel](https://github.com/Khan/tota11y/tree/master/plugins/shared/info-panel) and [annotate](https://github.com/Khan/tota11y/tree/master/plugins/shared/annotate) modules, which are used to report accessibility violations on the screen.

[`index.js`](https://github.com/Khan/tota11y/blob/master/index.js) brings it all together.

tota11y uses a variety of technologies, including [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), [babel](https://babeljs.io/), and [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/). **There's no need to know all (or any!) of these to contribute to tota11y, but we hope tota11y is a good place to learn something new and interesting.**

## Testing

You can run unit tests on tota11y with the following:

```
npm test
```

Or lint with:

```

To perform manual testing as you work, you can run a live dev-server with the
following:

```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/test/`. This page
will automatically reload with changes.

## Special thanks

Many of tota11y's features come straight from [Google Chrome's Accessibility Developer Tools](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/accessibility-developer-tools). We use this library heavily at [Khan Academy](http://khanacademy.org).
