# Topics 

## Reporting Discussion (Based on #2016 and #2017)
  - Great input from Steve to get some direction/questions on the table
  - Still need the context of the reports, filters, etc. (see follow up)
  - Want to maintain flexibility of being able to pull data into Excel, but want good UX for reporting
  - There may be additional fields required that we're not yet collecting; We'll suss this out from Jim's report notes (see follow up) and determine course of action from there.
  - Requests themselves may need stronger "typing" so that we can understand the intent and accomplishments of a completed request (i.e. this request was to install a number of smoke detectors / this request is completed with 2 installed smoke detectors ).
 
## Follow Up
  - Jim to provide some report samples, descriptions, screen shots/UX samples
  - James to document sendgrid approach
  - James to continue WebJobs port to Azure Functions
  - Jim to meet with Tony to discuss UX friction points that need approval
  - Pascal and Jim to review outstanding tags on GitHub
  - James/Steve to investigate architecture ideas (in the direction of CQRS) for keeping reports fast and web site responsive when reporting tasks executing
