# Topics 

## Priority Discussion (Based on Emily's notes)
  - SSO likely out of scope for 1.5
  - Focus on events (day-long itineraries)
  - Working with requests 
    - Based on (additional) map functionality
    - Bundling into itineraries
    - Matching to volunteers
    - Volunteers interacting with itineraries
  - Topically: Events, maps and UX (per Emily's notes) 
 
## New Issues to add (lower priority) 
  - Requester communications:
    - Ability to trigger pre-defined templates (I'm running late, On my way, etc.)
    - Reminder communications (48 hours lead time)

## Current Priority List

  2) Map
  3) Requester Communications
  4) UX
  5) Data reporting
  6) Documentation
