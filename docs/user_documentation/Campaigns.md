## <a name='Overview'/> Overview
Campaigns, which are created for an Organization, are the base object for the other elements of the campaigns, such as events, tasks and itineraries.  The location for a campaign, may be diferent from the location for and organization.  For example, a campaign might be regional and serviced out of a regional location differnt from the busines address of the organization.  Events, which will be discussed in a separate section, can also have a location for each event that is different from both the Organization address and the campaign address.

Now the Campaign entry/edit screen will be displayed.  Most of the fields are self explanatory. The Name (1), Description (2), Headline (3), and Full Description (4) fields are displayed on the Campaign lists for users to be able to navigate to the required campaigns and events for volunteering and for managers to be able to manage campaign, events, and itineraries.  External Link (5), and External Link Text (6) are fields that allows a link to resources outside the Allready application (e.g. The Red Cross Internet Page).

Time Zone (7) is used by the system to map the campaign events into the appropriate time zone.  Start Date (8) and End Date (9) are as expected the anticipated start and end dates for the entire campaign. Organization (10) is a recommended prerequisite, and is the organization which is sponsoring and running the campaign (See Organization Management -- TBD insert link for Organization.md).  Featured (11) field prioritizes and emphasizes the campaign and it's events in the listings.  Published (12) indicates that the cammpaign is ready to be published to the lists in the system.  Browse for Image (13) allows you, as an administrator, to add an image to the campaign listing.  This image must reside on your local machine.  The Allready Campaign Management application will upload the image to the site and attach the links in the appropriate places in the site.

As you scroll down on the Campaign Edit/Entry Screen, you see the "Location" and Contact Section.  If the Organization has already been created and saved the "Copy Location and Primary Contact" button (1) will copy the Organization's Location and contact information into the fields in those sections.  otherwise, the user can either manually edit the information into fields or overwrite the information which was previously entered or copied.

Now it's time to save you work.  Click the "Create" button to save your work.  "Cancel" will irrecoverably flush your data and effort.
