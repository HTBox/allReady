## <a name='Overview'></a> Overview

This guide will walk through how you can message volunteers registered for a specific task in the allReady application.

## <a name='Prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites  
 
To be able to contact volunteers in a task, there must be registered volunteers for a task.

The user that sends the message has to be an administrator within the allReady application in order to see and use this option.

## <a name='User_Walkthrough'></a> User Walkthrough

First, a user has to sign into the allReady application with an administrator account.
Within Admin options, the user will select Campaigns.

Once on the Campaigns page, the user will select the campaign in question.

Once the campaign is selected, the user will scroll down to the Events section of the campaign, and click on the relevant event.

Now it's time to pick the actual task you're interested in contacting volunteers about. First scroll down and click on the relevant task.

You are now presented with details about the task and below all volunteers that have registered. To contact all, simply press the button marked "Message All"

You can now fill out the message that you want to send to your volunteers.

> Please be aware of the fact that the subject you entered will only be sent to people on their email and won't be included in any SMS messages sent from the system.

Once you're done with your message, simply press the "Send Message" button and it will be sent away to all volunteers that have signed up for the task at hand.

## <a name='Notes_and_Comments'></a> Notes and Comments

Messages sent this way will be sent to both the volunteers registered phone number AND email address. But **only** if they've been confirmed by the volunteer. This means that some volunteers might receive your message twice while others only once.
